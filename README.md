#Image Classification Filter for WEKA

Steps required to perform image classification in WEKA:

###1. Install the Image Filters Package

Run WEKA, and from the GUI menu, select Tools—>Package Manager.

When the Package Manager appears, find the package “imageFilters” in the list and click Install.

Restart WEKA.

###2. Download some images

You need to put all your images in the *same directory*.

For example, if you download the file [butterfly_vs_owl.zip](), you will find one directory containing 99 images.

###3. Create an ARFF file containing the image labels

###4. Run an experiment in the WEKA GUI
