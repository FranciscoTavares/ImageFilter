#Image Classification Filter for WEKA

##Preparing the datasets
Datasets (in ARFF format) should contain at least one attribute.
That attribute, in the *first* column of the dataset, should be the filename of a single image.
Additional attributes, such as the class and other non-image features, may also be in the dataset and they will not be modified by the filter.

For example, this is dogs.arff from the data folder:
````
@relation dogs
@attribute filename string
@attribute class {BEAGLE,GERMAN_SHORTHAIRED}
@data
img_beagle_1.jpg,BEAGLE
img_beagle_10.jpg,BEAGLE
img_beagle_12.jpg,BEAGLE
img_beagle_13.jpg,BEAGLE
img_beagle_14.jpg,BEAGLE
img_beagle_15.jpg,BEAGLE

##Using image filters from the WEKA GUI
Ensure that you have the ImageFilters package installed.
Then run WEKA as normal and open an ARFF file containing image filenames (such as the one shown above).

You can then select which filter you want to use to extract features from Filters/unsupervised/instance/imagefilters menu.

Clicking “Apply” after will add new numeric features to the dataset, one for each feature:
You can then remove the first attribute (the filename) and run some WEKA experiments on the dataset.

##Using image filters from the command line
All image filters can be run from the command line.
You will need to specify the following on the command line:

1. The filename to the ARFF file that contains the image filenames (specified using -i)
2. The filename to the ARFF file that the image features will be written to (specified using -o)
3. The name of the directory containing the images (specified using -D); this is only required if the working directory does not contain the images

For example:
````
java -cp classpath_to_weka weka.filters.unsupervised.instance.imagefilters.BasicImageFeatures -i dogs.arff -o dogs_features.arff -D /dir/with/images
````

The resulting file dogs_features.arff should look like this:
````
@relation dogs-weka.filters.unsupervised.instance.imagefilters.BasicImageFeatures-D/dir/with/images/

@attribute filename string
@attribute B0 numeric
@attribute B1 numeric
@attribute B2 numeric
@attribute B3 numeric
@attribute B4 numeric
@attribute B5 numeric
@attribute B6 numeric
@attribute B7 numeric
@attribute class {BEAGLE,GERMAN_SHORTHAIRED}

We now need to remove the string attribute from the dataset. 
This can be done easily from the command-line using WEKA’s RemoveType filter:
````
java -cp class path_to_weka weka.filters.unsupervised.attribute.RemoveType -T string -i dogs_features.arff -o dogs_features_nostrings.arff
````

##Performing an image classification experiment from the command line
Use the feature-extracted ARFF file to run experiments, e.g.:

````
java -cp classpath_to_weka weka.classifiers.functions.SMO -t dogs_features_nostrings.arff
````

## Cascading image filters from the command line
It is possible to apply the image filters one after the other, to get multiple different feature sets describing the same image.
To achieve this, simply store the intermediate dataset generated by each consecutive filter and apply the next filter to it, e.g.:
````
java -cp classpath_to_weka weka.filters.unsupervised.instance.imagefilters.BasicImageFeatures -i dogs.arff -o tmp1.arff -D /dir/with/images
java -cp classpath_to_weka weka.filters.unsupervised.instance.imagefilters.ColorLayoutImageFeatures -i tmp1.arff -o tmp2.arff -D /dir/with/images
java -cp classpath_to_weka weka.filters.unsupervised.instance.imagefilters.EdgeHistogramImageFeatures -i tmp2.arff -o dogs_features.arff -D /dir/with/images
java -cp classpath_to_weka weka.filters.unsupervised.attribute.RemoveType -T string -i dogs_features.arff -o dogs_features_nostrings.arff
rm tmp1.arff
rm tmp2.arff
rm tmp3.arff
rm dogs_features.arff
````
